This example demonstrates a common pitfall in Ruby: the unexpected immutability of instance variables when only a getter method is defined.  The `value` method acts as a getter, but there's no setter, resulting in attempts to modify the instance variable through the getter failing silently.  This can lead to bugs where the internal state of an object doesn't reflect the expected changes.
